## Goals for today

1. Think about why & how we use traditional (frequentist) statistics
1. Think about how we make decisions everyday
1. Combine the two into a statistical framework
1. Discuss how we use these approaches in my lab to make draw conclusions based on data

---

## How do trainees learn statistics?

### Undergraduate

- Mostly not required for undergraduate science majors (e.g., biology)

### Graduate

- One or more courses
- Practical experience

### School of Medicine

- Someday to be an MCAT prerequisite
- IPC4 initially at MU via Epidemiology

## Frequentist approaches

![:scale 80%](https://i.imgur.com/guHfGWo.png)

---

## Common assumptions

- Homogeneity of variances
- Normality of residuals
- Large sample sizes
- Experiments repeated

---

## P-values and the peril of null hypothesis testing

> What is the probability of observing these data if the null hypothesis were true?

**Fisher**: *P*-values as a ad hoc indicator

**Neyman & Pearson**: Choosing from among statistical models

---

## The last ~50 years...

1. Fisher's P < 0.05 is "significant"
    - Fisher though 0.05 was "good enough"
2. Neyman and Pearson's hypothesis testing
    - Not considering "null hypotheses"
    - Straw man hypothesis (no difference, no effect)

## Null hypothesis statistical testing

1. Design experiment
1. Collect data
1. Analyze data, evaluate *P*-value
    - Reject null hypothesis (or not)
1. Conclude

## Inverse probability

> Given that a poker player has dealt three hands in a row with four aces, *what is the probability that the dealer is cheating*?

## Bayesian clinical reasoning

**Data**: Your patient has a cough

**Hypotheses**:

--

1. Patient has a cold

--

2. Patient has lung cancer

--

3. Patient has gastroenteritis

---

# Priors

Some reasonable priors:

--

1. Cold (lifetime risk ~99%)

--

2. Lung cancer (lifetime risk ~6%)

--

3. Gastroenteritis (lifetime risk ~99%)


---

# Posterior

1. High prior x high likelihood = high posterior probability

--

2. Low prior x low likelihood = low posterior probability

--

3. High prior x low likelihood = low posterior probability

## Bayesian decisions

> The only real novelty on the Bayesian approach lies in the fact that it provides a *formal mechanism* for taking account of these preferences and weights instead of leaving it to the decision maker's unaided intuition to determine their implications. We believe, however, that without this formalization decisions under uncertainty have been and will remain essentially arbitrary, as evidenced by the fact that, in most statistical practice, consequences and performance characteristics receive mere lip service while decisions are actually made by treating the numbers .05 and .95 with the same superstitious awe that is usually reserved for the number 13.

## A little math

$$P(a, b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$

$$P(a,b) = P(b|a)P(a)$$

$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$

---

## For scientific inference

$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$

$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypo)P(hypo)}{P(data)}$$

$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypo)P(hypo)}{\Sigma_{h'\in H}P(d'|h')P(h')}$$

Posterior probability is the product of the likelihood and prior normalized by their sum (to make the probability sum to 1).

---

## Rolling dice

$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$

$$P(roll~1, roll~1) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$$

## Mechanics of Bayesian inference

## Why now (and not 100 years ago)?

1. Fisher looms large
1. Monte Carlo methods (Manhattan Project)
1. Computers (ENIAC)
