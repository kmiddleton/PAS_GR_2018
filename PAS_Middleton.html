What is the probability of getting dealt 4 aces in a poker hand?

`$$\frac{4}{52}\frac{3}{51}\frac{2}{50}\frac{1}{49}\frac{48}{48}\times 5 = 0.000018 = 0.0018\%$$`

## Inverse probability

&gt; Given that a poker player has dealt three hands in a row with four aces, *what is the probability that the dealer is cheating*?

`$$0.000018^3 = 0.00000000000058\%$$`

## A little math

`$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$`

`$$P(a,b) = P(b|a)P(a)$$`

`$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$`
---

## For scientific inference

`$$P(b|a) = \frac{P(a|b)P(b)}{P(a)}$$`

`$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypo)P(hypo)}{P(data)}$$`

`$$P(hypothesis|data) = \frac{P(data|hypo)P(hypo)}{\Sigma_{h'\in H}P(d'|h')P(h')}$$`

Posterior probability is the product of the likelihood and prior normalized by their sum (to make the probability sum to 1).

## Rolling dice

`$$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$$`

`$$P(roll~1, roll~1) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$$`

1. One movie earned $100 million in the first weekend
2. The other movie earned $1 million in the first weekend

## Bayesian clinical reasoning

**Data**: Your patient has a cough

**Hypotheses**:

--

1. Patient has a cold

--

2. Patient has lung cancer

--

3. Patient has gastroenteritis

---

# Priors

Some reasonable priors:

--

1. Cold (lifetime risk ~99%)

--

2. Lung cancer (lifetime risk ~6%)

--

3. Gastroenteritis (lifetime risk ~99%)


---

# Posterior

1. High prior x high likelihood = high posterior probability

--

2. Low prior x low likelihood = low posterior probability

--

3. High prior x low likelihood = low posterior probability

## Bayesian decisions

&gt; The only real novelty on the Bayesian approach lies in the fact that it provides a *formal mechanism* for taking account of these preferences and weights instead of leaving it to the decision maker's unaided intuition to determine their implications. We believe, however, that without this formalization decisions under uncertainty have been and will remain essentially arbitrary, as evidenced by the fact that, in most statistical practice, consequences and performance characteristics receive mere lip service while decisions are actually made by treating the numbers .05 and .95 with the same superstitious awe that is usually reserved for the number 13.
